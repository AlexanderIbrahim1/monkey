# Reminder: Memory (RAM) vs Mass Storage (HD, SSD, etc.)

RAM
- volatile memory
- very expensive
- very fast to read from and write to
- relatively small in size (4GB to 32GB today)

Mass Storage
- persistent memory
- relative cheap
- slower to read from and write to
- relatively large in size (128GB to several TB)
