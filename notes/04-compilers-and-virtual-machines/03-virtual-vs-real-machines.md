# Virtual Machine


## The "other" type of virtual machine
There are things we call "virtual machines" like Virtualbox or VMWare
- they emulate a computer; its disk drive, hard drive, graphics card, etc.
- they let you run "another computer" on your computer, possibly with another OS

We will talk about another type of virtual machine; the ones used for implementing programming languages


## Our virtual machines
Virtual machines for programming languages *are* the machine that the executable runs on
- they are called "virtual" because they are implemented in software, not hardware
- they mimic the behaviour of hardware (registers, stack frames, etc.)
