## What is an interpreter?
The interpreter takes the source code, and gives meaning to the different parts that make up the code

There is a large variety of interpreters, but they have one thing in common:
- they take source code, and evaluate it, *without* producing some kind of executable image
- as opposed to compilers, which *do* produce an executable image

What will the interpreter of the Monkey language feature?
- a lexer
