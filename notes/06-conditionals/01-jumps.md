# Conditional and Unconditional Jumps

In a VM, a jump instruction tells the VM to shift the stack pointer to a different address
There are two types of jump instructions:
1. conditional jump instructions
 - only modify the stack pointer if a certain condition evaluates to True
2. unconditional jump instructions
 - modify the stack pointer no matter what
