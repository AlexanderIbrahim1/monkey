# monkey

This project is a Python implementation of the "Monkey" language described in Thorsten Ball's books:
- Writing an Interpreter in Go (2016)
- Writing a Compiler in Go (2018)

Instead of using Go, I'm following the contents of the book, and writing the interpreter and compiler in Python.

# TODO
- improve README to make it easier for viewers to navigate the project
- include examples of:
  - using the compiler to turn source code into bytecote
  - using the virtual machine to execute the bytecode
